\figref{unphosphorylated_bond3} shows the distance between termini for the unphosphorylated fragments starting with extended and native conformations.
The unphosphorylated extended structure folds during the simulation but does not conform to a stable state.
\figref{unphosphorylated_extended_states} shows conformations of unphosphorylated extended structure at different stages of simulation.

\figref{phosphorylated_bond3} shows the distance between termini for phosphorylated fragments starting with extended and native conformations.
