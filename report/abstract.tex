  	The structure of inherently disordered proteins (IDPs) is notoriously difficult to solve by either X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy, but recent findings by Bah \textit{et al.} suggest that phosphorylation of certain IDPs imposes a fixed secondary structure on the proteins. We attempt to replicate these findings computationally and explain the mechanism behind the transitions to ordered conformations catalyzed by phosphorylation. Phosphorylated and unphosphorylated protein fragments in multiple starting conformations are simulated with molecular dynamics. Free energy perturbation simulations in which a phosphate ion is alchemically added to the phosphorylation site are used to further understand this phenomenon.
