  	After reading Bah et al.'s recent writing, "Folding of an intrinsically disordered protein by phosphorylation as a regulatory switch", we wanted to explore the phenomena discussed in the paper by examining phosphorylated phosphorytes in inherently disordered proteins.  Noting that this may be a significant mechanism of IDP functionality, we computationally addressed the topic by simulating phosphorylated and unphosphorylated versions of the protein and evaluating the statistical energies of the conformations.  We did this both with and without post translational modifications (PTM).
	Ultimately, we gathered significant information on the function of phosphorylation on IDP's...
